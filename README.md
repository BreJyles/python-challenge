 In our recent class project, we delved into the practical applications of Python by utilizing two real-world simulations, pybank and pypoll. Through pybank we worked with
financial datasets to calculate key monetary metrics, such as the total amount of profit/losses over a period and the average changes in revenue between months. This not
only reinforced our understanding of Pythons computational capabilities but also how cold can stream line financial analysis. Pypoll allowed us to enagage with election
data, where we wrote python code to tally votes, determine the percentage each candidate won, and ultimatley, identify the winner of the election. these excercises
provided hands-on experience with Python's versatility in data analysis and its powerful role in automating and simpifying complex tasks within different domains.
